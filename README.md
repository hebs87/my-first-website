# My Very First Webpage

This is the first webpage that I built. To build this, I followed the tutorial videos in the course content of The Coding Institute's Full Stack Web Developer course.

The webpage consists of three streams, all of which contain 6 cards and links. Each link directs users to the wikipedia page of the web framework that is displayed on the card.

## Rationale

The purpose of this project was to introduce me to the coding platform (Cloud9), Git and GitHub, and to familiarise myself with how to use them.
During the project, I also learned how to create directories and files, and move them to Git and GitHub, all through using commands in Terminal.

## Getting Started

The link to my GitHub repository is https://github.com/hebs87/my-first-website

The link to deploy my webpage on the live system is in the **_Deployment_** section
